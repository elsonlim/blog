      <h1>How to train a Dragon</h1>
      <article>
        The Viking village of Berk, located on a remote island, is attacked
        frequently by dragons, which take livestock and damage property. Hiccup,
        the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the
        Vast, is deemed too scrawny and weak to fight the dragons, so he instead
        creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the
        village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. During
        one attack, Hiccup uses a bolas launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a
        dangerous and rare dragon of which little is known, but no one believes
        him, so he searches for the fallen dragon on his own. He finds the
        dragon in the forest, tangled in his net, but cannot bring himself to
        kill it, and instead sets it free.
